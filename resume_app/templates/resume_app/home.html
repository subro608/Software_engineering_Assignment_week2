        <p><b>Computer Vision engineer</b> - Bigvision.ai (Bengaluru, Karnataka)<br>
            June 2022 - June 2024<br>
        
        <div class="container">
        <ul>
            <li>Engineered people and vehicle detection systems utilizing Yolov5n models, trained across MWIR, LWIR, SWIR, and RGB datasets,
                achieving F1-scores of 84.78%, 96.43%, 79.43%, and 86.58%, respectively </li>
            <li>Enhanced the performance analysis of Yolov5 models, by incorporating additional Alarm-based and Kalman filter-based tracking
                algorithms, enabling more precise and reliable tracking across diverse sequences and conditions.</li>
            <li>Optimized Google Colab notebooks for an AI art generator course, developed in collaboration with OpenCV. Achieved significant
                resource efficiency by implementing Quantization and an 8-bit Adam optimizer, which reduced VRAM requirements from 22GB to
                10GB. </li>
            <li>The AI art generator course raised approximately $143,000 on Kickstarter, which showcases the substantial interest generated by
                the course. </li>
            <li>Led a resume analysis project at Bigvision.ai, shifting from GPT-4 to GPT-3.5 using OpenAI APIs, which reduced API costs by 20
                times through advanced prompt engineering. </li>
            <li>Accelerated the hiring process with a GPT-3.5 driven resume analysis tool that reviewed over 200 applications, drastically reducing
                the shortlisting time from 7-8 hours to just 10 minutes. This significant time reduction resulted in the swift recruitment of two
                interns for Bigvision.ai </li>
            <li>Accelerated the transformation of real estate images from day to night by automating the process. Trained a CycleGAN model for
                image conversion and utilized a YOLOv5 model to detect window bounding boxes, streamlining the editing workflow </li>
        </ul>

        <div class="container">
        <ul>
            <li> Developed and deployed the first-ever model 360StereoNet, capable of taking 360-degree stereoscopic images and generating
                depth maps, using a spatial pyramid pooling (PSMNet) based approach. Achieved an initial PSNR of 19.0 dB after 6 epochs, and
                further refined the model by cleaning the training data with a Naive Bayes based image inpainting method, which improved the
                PSNR by an additional 0.9 dB. </li>
